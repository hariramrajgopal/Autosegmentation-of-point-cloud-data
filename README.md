# Autosegmentation-of-point-cloud-data
This project is on the Automatic Segmentation of a point cloud data done on Blender. 
We have taken advantage of the Point Cloud Visualizer add-on for the importing of the point cloud and done the segmentation using 


One of the main pre-requisites of this code is the Point Cloud Visualizer add-on in Blender.

If unable to add the add-on, the path of the PCD (Point Cloud Data) can be harcoded into the code.
